Program Algorithm :

STEP 1. Start
STEP 2. Setup trigger pin and echo pin for the ultrasonic sensor
STEP 3. Initialise duration and distance
STEP 4. Set trigger pin as input
STEP 5. Set pins for the buzzer and vibrator and echo pin as output
STEP 6. Inside a loop, set trigger pin and echo pin as high
STEP 7. Calculating distance using, distance= duration* 0.034/2
STEP 8. If distance is less than 25 vibrator will vibrates and buzzer make beep sound
STEP 9. If distance is less than 50 vibrator will vibrates and buzzer will make sound.
STEP 10. If distance is less than 75 vibrator will vibrates intensively
STEP 11. If distance is less than 100 vibrator will vibrates very intensively.
STEP 12. If the distance is greater than 100 vibrator and buzzer will be off.
STEP 13. Stop.
